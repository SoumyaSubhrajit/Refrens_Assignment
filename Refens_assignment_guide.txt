Below is the step-by-step process for the given API assignment:

Step 1: Set up the Node.js project

Create a new Node.js project.
Initialize a package.json file to manage dependencies.
Step 2: Install required dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for the project, such as Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, and any other libraries or packages required.
Step 3: Design and implement the Login API

Create an API endpoint for user login.
Validate the user's credentials (e.g., username and password) against the database.
Use appropriate hashing and encryption techniques to securely store and compare passwords.
Generate and return a JWT (JSON Web Token) upon successful authentication.
Step 4: Design and implement the Tambula ticket creation API

Create an API endpoint for creating Tambula tickets.
Accept the number of tickets as a variable parameter.
Generate unique tickets using the given rules and sample ticket array.
Store the generated tickets in the database.
Return a unique ID for each ticket created.
Step 5: Design and implement the Tambula ticket fetch API

Create an API endpoint for fetching Tambula tickets.
Accept the unique ID associated with the tickets as a parameter.
Implement pagination logic to fetch tickets in chunks.
Retrieve the associated tickets from the database based on the provided ID.
Return the fetched tickets as a response.
Step 6: Set up the database

Set up the chosen database (MongoDB/MySQL) and establish a connection from the Node.js application.
Design and create the necessary database schema or collections to store user credentials and generated tickets.
Step 7: Implement security measures

Implement proper input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection).
Use prepared statements or ORM libraries to ensure safe database operations.
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse or DoS attacks.
Set up appropriate CORS headers to restrict cross-origin requests.
Implement authentication middleware to validate JWT for protected API endpoints.
Step 8: Implement additional features and validations

Implement response time monitoring and optimization techniques to ensure good API performance.
Perform data validations on user input and return appropriate error messages for invalid requests.
Add logging mechanisms to track API usage and errors for debugging and analysis purposes.
Implement additional security checks, such as input sanitization and output encoding, to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
Step 9: Test the APIs

Write unit tests and integration tests to validate the functionality of the APIs.
Use testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, or Jest to automate the testing process.
Perform manual testing to ensure the APIs work as expected.
Test various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.
Step 10: Deployment

Deploy the Node.js application to a suitable hosting environment or server.
Set up the necessary configurations for production-grade deployment, including environment variables, logging, and monitoring.
Note: The above steps provide a general guideline for completing the assignment. You may need to adapt and modify them according to your specific project requirements and coding style preferences.
